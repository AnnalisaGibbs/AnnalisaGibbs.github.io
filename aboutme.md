My name is Annalisa Gibbs. I am a Data Science student and the Founder of Eden's Farm. Eden's Farm is a non profit focused on providing resources to survivors of human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. 

I am a wife, a homeschooling mom of five boys and an avid gardener and a doula. I have a degree in pastry arts from Le Cordon Bleu and have worked in kitchens and hotels across the country.
